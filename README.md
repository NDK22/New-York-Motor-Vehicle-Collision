# New-York-Motor-Vehicle-Collision
New York Motor Vehicle Collision Data Analysis
The crux of the project was to analyze the trend in number of accidents in New York City from September 2017 to August 2019.
Cleaned & modified the data by using Python’s Pandas package in order to extract appropriate vehicle names and grouped the data by months and by years.
Created compelling visualizations using Python’s Matplotlib package. These visualizations helped us to understand various analysis like car maker with most accidents in a year, trend in number of accidents over months, & type of vehicle with most accidents.
